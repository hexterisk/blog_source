Hi, I'm [Bhanupratap Singh](https://hexterisk.tech), a final-year undergraduate student with a demonstrated history of working in the cyber-security and development industry. Skilled in reverse engineering, binary exploitation and forensics, along with development operations in the field of information security.

These blogs are a collection of the notes I have made from various books and blogs with an aim to create a single store of everything I read, so as to revisit or refer to them at a later date. I hope the community benefits from these, as I have from various other sources.
